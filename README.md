--Kernel functions
-Linear
These are commonly recommended for text classification because most of these types of classification problems are linearly separable.

The linear kernel works really well when there are a lot of features, and text classification problems have a lot of features. Linear kernel functions are faster than most of the others and you have fewer parameters to optimize.

Here's the function that defines the linear kernel:

f(X) = w^T * X + b
